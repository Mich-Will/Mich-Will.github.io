Entry level Cybersecurity student interested in protecting information and helping others. I love to protect people from mis/dis/mal-information and want to preserve data for the future. I love the outdoors and want to preserve our environment as well.

I am working on multiple projects, and plan to upload them weekly to document my security progress.
